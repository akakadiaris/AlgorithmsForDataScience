# Algorithms For Data Science

This repository includes the programming assignments from CSOR4246 Algorithms for Data Science Course at Columbia University. 

**Homework 3** focused on implementing depth-first search for identifying the connected components of an undirected graph, implementing procedure Search as a subroutine along the way.  NetworkX Python package was utilized to represent and manipulate graphs. The use case for this assignment was use case a dataset recording the interactions between characters in Homer's Iliad

**Homework 4** focused on investigating applications of finding a Max Flow. The problem asks you to design and implement an algorithm for shipping a material between nodes with different supply and demand requirements.
